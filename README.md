Run with `python -m p3` before opening Dolphin. Stop with ^C.

Requires Python 3. You'll need to configure the pipe input in Dolphin for player 3. See `example_gc_config.ini` for an example Dolphin profile. Turn on the "Netplay Community Settings" Gecko code before booting the game.

Test with `python -m unittest discover -p "*_test.py"`.
